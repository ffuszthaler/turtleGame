# Turtle Guardians

## TODO
- "game over" states & screens (ask if even necessary for level 1)
- new random turtle seeker positions seem buggy - random positions way too close to target (maybe ask lukas?)
- bird ai & gameplay logic (ask lukas for help)
- fine tune camera (feels weird, fov, crosshair) & movement (too fast)
- make ui look nicer
- level design
- game audio
